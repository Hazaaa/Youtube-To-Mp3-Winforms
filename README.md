**NOTICE:** This is just me working and experimenting with .Net 6 and different libraries. This app will not be used for anything except leveling up my coding skills and increasing my knowledge of .Net Core.

## Requirements:
 - This app is developed in .Net 6 so to run it you will need [.Net 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).  
 - For converting this app is using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) so you will have to download it and place just ffmpeg.exe and place it inside of Resources folder of the app.

## Releases:
 - [v1.0 - Portable Version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1beEFgxKeNLtHQKA7TAfBwf89HcZnrokK/view?usp=sharing)

## TODO's:
 - Create installer.
 - Add tests.
 - <del>Show video thumbnail (and maybe set it as cover).</del>
 - Add options for bit rates.
 - Add option for converting to different formats not just mp3.
 - Don't use ffmpeg.exe file.
 - <del>Fix UI thread blocking.</del>
 - Make UI a little bit modern.
 - <del>Fix displaying errors correctly.</del>
 - <del>Fix progress bar update.</del>
 - Add option to just download video.
 - Fix: If name of video has white spaces error occures.
